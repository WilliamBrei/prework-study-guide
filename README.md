# prework-study-guide


## Description

What was your motivation?
My motivation was to create a comprehensive study guide for prework to assist new learners in understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to reinforce my own understanding of these fundamental technologies and to provide a helpful resource for others beginning their coding journey.
What problem does it solve?
It organizes and summarizes essential prework information in a clear and accessible format, helping new learners to review and consolidate their knowledge.
What did you learn?
I learned how to structure HTML documents, apply CSS for styling, use Git for version control, and write basic JavaScript functions. Additionally, I practiced integrating these technologies into a cohesive web project.

## Usage

he Prework Study Guide Webpage is designed to help new learners review fundamental concepts in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section on the webpage contains notes about a specific topic:

HTML: This section covers the basics of HTML, including the structure of an HTML document, common tags, and attributes.
CSS: This section provides information on how to style HTML elements using CSS, including properties like margin, padding, color, and text-align.
Git: This section introduces Git commands such as git clone, git status, git checkout, and git init, explaining their usage in version control.
JavaScript: This section explains fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and arrays.
To see the JavaScript output in action, open the DevTools console in your web browser. The console will display the topics learned from prework and allow you to select a topic to study first. For example, you will see messages like "Let's study HTML!" based on the topic selected.
